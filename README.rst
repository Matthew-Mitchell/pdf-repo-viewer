=====================
PDF Repository Viewer
=====================

A Flask app that will serve pdf files from a repository.


A demo can be viewed here

* https://pdf-repo-viewer.herokuapp.com/


What it does
------------

Lets a user navigate through your directory to view pdf files.


What it doesn't
---------------

Add files.  Delete files.  Prevent anyone from viewing files.


Motivation
----------

I needed a central location for pdf reports that are accessible by anyone.  The good thing about pdf files is
that they are viewable in a browser, so you really don't need adobe acrobat or anything special installed on your computer.
You can view pdfs from your phone or computer, and as long as you structure your reports in an understandable way,
users will easily find your reports.
